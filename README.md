# Financial-Audit-Deep-Learning-
With the rise of digital transactions and the expansion of online financial services, fraud has become a significant threat to the financial industry. Real-time fraud detection can shield individuals from criminal conduct and save organisations from significant financial losses. Nevertheless, the intricacy and diversity of fraud patterns, along with the possibility of substantial overlap with typical behaviour, make it difficult to reliably discern between authentic and fraudulent transactions. To improve model accuracy, I investigated a range of factors, such as transaction characteristics and time-based data, using a dataset of transaction records. This project leverages a dense neural network with two hidden layers to develop a robust predictive system capable of analyzing and classifying complex data patterns. By examining both linear and non-linear relationships within the dataset, this approach aims to enhance classification accuracy through the intricate pattern recognition enabled by deep learning. The findings and insights from this project aim to contribute to the development of scalable and accurate fraud detection systems that can be adapted across various transaction contexts. By comparing the strengths and limitations of machine learning and deep learning approaches, this project offers a foundation for future research and practical applications, ultimately supporting the goal of more secure and resilient financial systems.
OBJECTIVES:
Real-Time Classification Focus: Unlike traditional fraud detection models, which may rely on batch processing or retrospective analysis, this approach focuses on real-time transaction evaluation for immediate decision-making.
Continuous Model Improvement: While other models may require manual updates or adjustments, this system will be designed to adapt to evolving fraud patterns with minimal human intervention, offering greater flexibility and automation
